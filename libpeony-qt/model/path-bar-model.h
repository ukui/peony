/*!
 * \brief The PathBarModel class
 * \details
 * PathBarModel is desgin for path completions.
 * This model would cache a directory driect children when the target uri
 * was set.
 * \note
 * A completion is theoretically responsive, so the enumeration of model
 * items should be as fast as possible.
 * It must be fast and lightweight enough to keep the ui-frequency.
 * For now, it performs well at local file system, but not good enough at
 * remote fs.
