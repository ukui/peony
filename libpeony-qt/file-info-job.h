 * \brief The FileInfoJob class
 * <br>
 * FileInfoJob provide both sync and async method querying of an FileInfo
 * instance. Both of them will send the info's FileInfo::updated() signal.
 * For query async, it aslo send FileInfoJob::queryAsyncFinished() signal
 * when job finished.
 * </br>
 * \note
 * Operations that querying a file's information might be very frequent,
 * so I recommend querying in asynchronous and cancellable ways.
 * Using queryAsync() will cancel the all existing querying job about this shared info.
 * Alternatively, the share info data will be refresh when last async job finished.
 * This desgin is similar to peony(caja).
