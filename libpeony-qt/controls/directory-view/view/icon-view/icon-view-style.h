/*!
 * \brief The IconViewStyle class
 * \details
 * This class is aim to provide a custom style for IconView's items.
 * In Qt5, item view draw its items from styled delegate by default,
 * even though we can implement a item's painting in delegate's paint().
 * I think it is better to follow Qt's desgin.
 * I mainly use this class control the internal layout of a item. It will
 * combine with delegate's paint() method.
