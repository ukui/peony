/*!
 * \brief The FileInfoManager class
 * <br>
 * This is a class used to share FileInfo instances acrossing various members.
 * It is a single instance class with a hash table that cached all infos.
 * We generally would not operate directly on instance of this class,
 * because FileInfo class provides an interface for this class.
 * use FileInfo::fromUri(), FileInfo::fromPath() or FileInfo::fromGFile()
 * for getting the corresponding shared data.
 * </br>
 * \note The memory management is based on std smart pointer, but it is not regular.
 * Because hash table always hold a use count of shared data. If you want to use
 * shared data of this class instance, you should remenmber this point:
 * When releasing your info resources, you aslo need to add an additional judgment that whether
 * there is no other member but you and manager instance hold this shared data.
 * If true, you should aslo remove the element in manager's hash for really releasing resources.
 * Otherwise, it might cause an one-time memory leak.
 * \see FileInfo, FileInfoJob, FileEnumerator; FileInfo::~FileInfo(), FileInfoJob::~FileInfoJob(),
 * FileEnumerator::~FileEnumerator().
 * \bug
 * Even though I try my best to make share the file info data, it seems that the info is not be shared
 * sometimes. Maybe there were some wrong in other classes?
