/*!
 * \brief The BorderShadowEffect class
 * \details
 * This class is used to decorate a frameless window.
 * It provides a border shadow which can be adjusted.
 *
 * The effect is similar to QGraphicsDropShadowEffects,
 * but it doesn't blur allow the window. It just render
 * a border for toplevel window, whatever if the window
 * is transparent and whatever element on the window.
 *
 * \note
 * To let the effect works,
 * You have to use it on toplevel window, and let the
 * window has an invisible contents margins.
 *
 * If your window has a border radius, use setBorderRadius()
 * for matching your window border rendering.
