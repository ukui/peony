     * In most filemanagers, files always show their display name at directory view,
     * but there were a special kind of files not, the .desktop files might show
     * their names based on their contents.
     * Rename Operation have to both effect at the normal files and .desktop files(executable).
     * \note
     * Rename a .desktop file is very complex. Because it would change the contents of the file.
     * In GLib/GIO's api, it will lost some attribute if change the file contents.
