 * \brief The FileNode class
 * <br>
 * This class contains 3 parts:
 * 1. the self info, such as uri, basename, etc,
 * 2. the parent node and list of children,
 * 3. the reporter handle.
 * </br>
 * <br>
 * FileNode is smilar to FileItem, but it is more simple. It is used with many limitation.
 * Cause it method is Synchronized, you should never try use this class in the ui-thread.
 * This class is desgined for file operation classes which running in other threads.
 * For example, a copy operation might need enumerate all children for get the total size
 * of the source files.
 * </br>
 * <br>
 * The FileNodeReporter handle is used for send signal to tell other object the current state
 * of file node enumeration. Actually, a FileNode instance always be with a FileNodeReproter
 * instance at its initialization.
 * </br>
 * \see FileNodeReporter.
